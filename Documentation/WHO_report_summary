# 6 Genes we are reporting through NeST



-pfCRT(chloroquine resistance transporter)
 
Localized within the membrane of the digestive vacuole of Pf. It import toxic effect as chloroquine accumulates high. Mutations reduce chloroquine accumulation in this organelle.

-cytb(cytochrome b)
Atovaquone related : Atovaquone-proguanil is recommend for chemoprophylaxix for travelers.
 
-pfDHFR(dihydrofolate reductase) -SP(anti-folate) related
 in the folate synthesis pathway
(-> time) S108N, N51I, C59R, I164L(absolute mutation)

-pfDHPS(dihydropteroate synthase) - SP related
in the folate synthesis pathway
 
S436A, A437G, K540E, A581G, A613T
 
-pfK13(P.falciparum Kelch 13)
 
Essential for erythrocytic stages
Energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased druc accumulation in multi-drug-resistant cells
P.falciparam resistanct to the drug cq have multiple copies of gene coding for MDR
Resistance emerged in southeast Asia
Highest prevalence of PfK13 mutations in GMS , C580Y
Rwanda, R561H
Related to changes in clearance time
